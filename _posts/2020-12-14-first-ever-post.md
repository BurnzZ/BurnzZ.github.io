So I've decided to ramp up my writing skills for 2020! ðŸ™Œ

I'm aiming to write **at least 1 blog post per month** to set the pace.
Though I'm also looking forward to write shorter posts that would act as
my personal notes whenever I learn something new in my work/career or some
other interesting stuff.

Looking forward to 2021! ðŸŽ‰
